## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned a new method to change use the svg imges and change their color on query events in this case on hover.

change the svg color exactly in the color i need using filters

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
.facebook:hover {
  /* #1976d2 */
  filter: invert(44%) sepia(56%) saturate(1105%) hue-rotate(178deg) brightness(
      81%
    ) contrast(105%);
}
```

### Continued development

This is the first landing page i do, Can see that the aproach is different than others and need to work more in my use of the space in the page, was a great challenge for me
